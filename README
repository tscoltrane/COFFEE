This is a very minimalist, simple menu system written in Python 2.7.
Although it's basically just pseudocode for a system I intend to implement
in C++, it's nonetheless a perfectly legitimate/functional system.

The use of +/- to increment/decrement values facilitates an easy transition
to the use of buttons for input (this is meant to run on an Arduino
microcontroller).  Please feel free to use this code for non-commerical,
open-source projects.  No other use is authorized.
